# Hello Aire Logic

### Background

Aire Logic is considering ditching it's tech for good status and branching out into online gambling. They would like you to create a proof of concept of a program that can deal a hand of cards and do some analysis on the hand you've been given.

#### Acceptance criteria

Shuffling and dealing

The first function
1. WHEN the function is called THEN all 52 cards are printed in a random order

The second function
2. GIVEN that the function is given 2 valid cards WHEN the function is called THEN the function prints whether the second card is "higher" or "lower" than the first card


Stretch goals
- All functionality can called from the command line using command line arguments
- Create a 2 player blackjack game
- Add a UI in tkinter that makes the game more engaging


### Prerequisites

- python 3

### Getting started

The project has one file `main.py` which calls the `main` function when the file is run. To check you're all set up properly, `cd` into the `solution` directory (instructions [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-cd-command#:~:text=The%20Linux%20cd%20command%20offers,a%20built%2Din%20shell%20command)) and run the following command in the terminal.

`python main.py` 


If it's working you should see "Hello Aire Logic" printed out to the terminal.

Feel free to add more files / directories as needed to keep your code well structured and organised
