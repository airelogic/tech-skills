# Time to improve your t-aire-chnical skills!

This repository is a place where anyone in Aire Logic can set or complete small technical exercises in order to improve their proficiency in a particular language or skill set.

The goal for this repo is to have a broad range of technical exercises for all ability levels in multiple languages


## Getting involved

### Have a go at one of the exercises

Pre-requisites:
* A github account
* Access to a unix terminal (if you're on windows, you'll either need to download [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) )
* Somewhere to write your code. There are lots of IDE's out there and people have very strong opinions about which ones to use - if you don't have a strong opinion, then VSCode is probably your best bet as a good "all

Steps:
    
1. Find an exercise at your level in the language you're interested in

Choose the subfolder of the language that you're interested in, then choose the subfolder of the difficulty level. Within each "exercise" there will be a Readme.md file that explains the content of the exercise and how to set up the exercise on your local machine.

2. Checkout a branch using `git checkout -b <exercise-name>_<your-name>`

If you've not used Git Version Control before check out a simple guide [here](https://linuxhint.com/git_tutorial_beginners/)

3. Get coding!

Start writing the code for your solution! If you're new to coding you'll have lots of questions - the best place to answer them is probably StackOverflow (just google the question and stackoverflow is usually one of the first hits) but you can also ask on the newly created #tech-skills Aire Logic channel

Don't forget to commit and push regularly and remember: good code without tests is bad code!

4. Create a pull request

When you're finished, make sure you've committed and pushed your latest code, then open a pull request against the main branch on Github [like so](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). Nice work!

5. Get some feedback

Once you've finished, post a link to your PR in the #tech-skill channel to ask for a review. Anyone can then take a look at your code, make comments, ask questions and give feedback

6. Improve your code

Possibly the most important part! Use the feedback you've received to improve your code! You may end up repeating steps 5 and 6 several times until you're happy with your code. Once you're done, there's no need to do anything - the pull request you've created will be a good reference for others wanting to try the exercise if they're stuck or looking for inspiration!


### Creating a new exercise

1. Create a set of instructions

These should full explain what you want the final solution to be. To make this as "realistic" as possible try to use the business language in tickets that you're familiar with, e.g. User stories, Acceptance criteria etc.

2. Create a Make command that will allow the user to create the necessary environment with as little hassle as possible

3. Create a PR using the directory structure of language -> difficulty level -> exercise

4. Post in #tech-skills for a review of the exercise before it's merged in

5. Merge it then publish it on #tech-skills as "Ready"
